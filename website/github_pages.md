# Getting started with GitHub Pages

<https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages>

*****************************************

You can set up a basic GitHub Pages site for yourself, your organization, or your project.

* About GitHub Pages
* Creating a GitHub Pages site
* Adding a theme to your GitHub Pages site with the theme chooser
* Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site
* Changing the visibility of your GitHub Pages site
* Creating a custom 404 page for your GitHub Pages site
* Securing your GitHub Pages site with HTTPS
* Using submodules with GitHub Pages
* Unpublishing a GitHub Pages site

You can add more pages to your site by creating more new files. Each file will be available 
on your site in the same directory structure as your publishing source. For example, if the 
publishing source for your project site is the `gh-pages` branch, and you create a new file 
called `/about/contact-us.md` on the `gh-pages` branch, the file will be available at 
`https://<user>.github.io/<repository>/about/contact-us.html`.

You can also add a theme to customize your site¡¯s look and feel. For more information, see "
[Adding a theme to your GitHub Pages site with the theme chooser.](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-with-the-theme-chooser)
"

To customize your site even more, you can use Jekyll, a static site generator with built-in 
support for GitHub Pages. For more information, see "
[About GitHub Pages and Jekyll.](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll)
